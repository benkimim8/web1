  They are also cute but <strong>the best is <u>Muni</u>.</strong></<p>

  It's a big question, but someone has to answer it:
  <br>Why do humans think cats are so cute?<br>
  Granted, not everyone feels this way. Debates between
   "cat people" and "dog people" rage on. But there's
   no denying that cats are beloved by huge numbers
   of humans. Although some argue that dogs recently
   overtook cats in internet popularity, no one denies
   that cats were No. 1 on the internet for years (and
   some argue that they still are).
